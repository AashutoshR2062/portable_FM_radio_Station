# Project Name
Portable FM radio Staion

## Summary
I have planned to build a Portable FM Radio Station that will be able to broadcast 
the audio signals from the microphone and will be able to play custom sound as well.
This radio station will be capable of broadcasting FM radio signal over a small area,
and can be taken on the go or set up at events.I am excited for this project because
it can be set up any where as it is portable and moreover I will get to know about how 
the FM Radio Station works.


## Plan
First things first I will do it to power the rasberry pi through micro USB cable using a powerbank, 
which the brain of the radio station as it will run the software needed to transmit audio through
the FM transmitter and receive audio input from the USB audio adapter.Then I will require a 
microphone headset to transmit live audio.After that I will be using 
a micro hdmi cable to connect the pi to the monitor then I will connect it to internet and install the 
software of the FM station. I will broadcast the audio through a the FM station and test the station by
receiving the signal through a fm radio Speaker. We will be able to play the audio at custom frequency 
and the fm radio speaker can pick those signals and play via speakers or even a FM Radio enabled 
smartphone can be used for that.If everything is working fine , then i will make custom 
cardboard enclosure for the radio station and wrap all the tools in single unit.
